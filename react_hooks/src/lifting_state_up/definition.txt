What is lifting state up in React JS?
--> Sometimes we have state that's located within a particular component that also needs to be shared with siblings components.
--> Instead of using entire an entire state management library like Redux or React context:
1.We just life the state up to the closest common ancestor and 
2. pass both the state variables the state values down as well as any callbacks to update that state.
